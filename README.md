# E-Commerce-Back-End

## About

I worked on the models, routes, and server with additional starter code on this project. A user can view and update products, categories, and product tags with this back end application that can be run in the terminal. It includes everything needed to create a database in the MySQL workbench. All of the routes can be tested in insomnia.
